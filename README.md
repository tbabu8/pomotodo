# Pomodoro Productivity App!

The Pomodoro Technique is used for time management, in which intervals of productivity (typically 25 min long) are separated by short breaks. This technique is helpful because it encourages focus, as it creates urgency for you to finish the task within the time limit. With this app, you can set a timer using your own intervals for focused work. Simply type in the number of minutes and click start.

This project was created using [React](https://legacy.reactjs.org/), a java script library, and [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/), a package manager for javascript softwares. I used this tutorial by [Xtina](https://github.com/xtina-park/pomodoro-app) for guidance and inspiration.

As this app is run locally, here is what the user should install to best run this project:
* npm (or yarn)
* create-react-app
* jquery
* styled-components
* react-hook-form
* react-confetti
* use-sound
* VS Code extensions: styled components by Julien, and ES7 React by dsznajder


Happy working!


# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
